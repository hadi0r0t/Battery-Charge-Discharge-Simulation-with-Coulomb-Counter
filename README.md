# Battery-Charge-Discharge-Simulation-with-Coulomb-Counter
A simple MATLAB/Simulink project for simulating battery charging and discharging. It uses an equivalent circuit model with a Coulomb counter to estimate state of charge. Made for learning and experimenting with battery management basics, not a full BMS.
